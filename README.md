# File Tree Export - README

**File Tree Export** is a simple yet powerful VSCode extension that allows you to **generate an ASCII file tree** from your selected files and folders in your workspace. Instead of merging file contents into one long text block, the extension produces a clean, hierarchical diagram that clearly shows your project's structure in a format optimized for AI ingestion and easy sharing.

## Features

- **Select Files & Folders:** Choose multiple files and folders from your workspace.
- **Generate ASCII File Tree:** Create a clear, textual representation of your file hierarchy (e.g., using symbols like `â”œâ”€â”€`, `â””â”€â”€`, and `â”‚`).
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the generated file tree for use in documentation or other applications.
- **Generate Text File:** Open a new text document containing the ASCII file tree for further editing or export.
- **Optimized for AI:** The simple and unambiguous structure makes it ideal for parsing by AI systems.

## Known Issues
